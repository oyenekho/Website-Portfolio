      <h3 class="amhead">First-time Coder</h3>
      <p class="ampcontent">Before this experience, I had never coded before. I didn't know anything when I first came to Nextech. Now I have the skills to build a website. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. My favorite language is definitely CSS because I like adding design elements to my code. I was able to build really cool projects because of the technical skills I gained.</p>
      <p class="ampcontent">Coding has also taught me skills that I will use in other areas of my life. It has taught me to pay more attention to detail because one wrong move can make everything go wrong. It has also made me more resilient. My code went wrong too many times to count but I was still able to push through and finish all my projects.</p>

      <h3 class="amhead">Music has always been in my life.</h3>
      <p class="ampcontent">I have been doing music my entire life. I don't remember a time where I wasn't invoved in at least one musical activity. I started off with singing and I really enjoy it. Fun fact: I was given the opportunity to sing the National Anthem at an Indy Fuel game.</p>
      <p class="ampcontent">In 3rd grade, I decided to join orchestra. Everyone picked the violin so I chose the viola, and I've been playing ever since. I am in the Metropolitan Youth Orchestra which is a branch of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. Because of this, I get to play at the Hilbert Circle Theatre twice a year and I also have yearly recitals.</p>
